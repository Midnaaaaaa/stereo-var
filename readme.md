To run this locally you need an http server is needed to run this.
Live demo at https://midnaaaaaa.github.io/stereo-var

You can drag and drop .obj models to import them to the CAVE system simulator.
A random color to each object is assigned.

Added features:
- Drag and drop .obj files
- Rendered view frustums for each display surface
- Improved drag controls
- WebXR integration but only the objects are rendered ðŸ˜¦
- Implemented hand tracking
- Imported models are normalized to always measure the same in the x-axis (to prevent importing very small models)
